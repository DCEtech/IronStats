# IRON STATS

Iron Stats is a simple MVP mobile app for tracking gym lifts.

⚠️ Note: This project is currently under active development. Some features may be incomplete or subject to change.

The main goal of this app is to create a personal tracker for my lifts without relying on text notes or other manual methods. I want a smooth and simple mobile app built with:

React Native – framework for the app.

SQLite – local storage for tracking lifts.

This is currently a proof of concept, but the vision is to expand its usability by:

Making lift tracking easier and more intuitive.

Adding AI-powered features to estimate theoretical PRs (personal records).
